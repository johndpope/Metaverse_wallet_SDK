# Metaverse Wallet NodeJS SDK
This NodeJS SDK provides encapsulation of calls to the Metaverse Full Node API.v2 (JSON-RPC 2.0) list, making it especially useful for users who want to build BaaS (block-as-a-service) applications. If you are interested in more basic usage of Metaverse, you can refer to Metaverse's official documentation.

Please note that this SDK is for MVS FULL NODE only.


If you have any problems using it, please let me know. You can leave a comment directly on the issues board, thank you very much!
